# PROFESSIONAL README GENERATOR

## Description
My motivation in creating this file generator is to expand my knowledge with using Node.Js.
I built this project to assist in making professional README.md files.
This will make them a lot quicker and simpler to do thus allowing me to focus on other aspects of the project.
I learned how to use Node.js and the inquirer package to help further my coding abilities.
